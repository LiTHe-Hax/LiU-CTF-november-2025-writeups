The QR code is scannable and seems to be normal, but the flag is hidden within the pixels of the QR code. If you scale the QR code so that each square is exactly 1 pixel, you can write a program that reads the pixels as binary data. Read the pixels from left-to-right, top-to-bottom and interpret the white and black pixels as 1:s and 0:s respectively. If you convert this sequence of 1:s and 0:s to ASCII you'll get a string that seems random, but if you use regex to search for a substring that looks like a flag (i.e. "HAX{...}"), you will find one. The substring is not yet readable, but if you use regex to filter out character that couldn't reasonably be in the flag (i.e. everything except `H`, `A`, `X`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `{`, `}`, and `_`) you will start the see words in the substring. Finally you will have to deduce which characters are part of the flag manually, which will give you the flag.
