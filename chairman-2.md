The string appears to be Base64 but decoding it gives gibberish... converting this to binary results in the hex string "c081cd91f2da06f1683733db20508010". The high entropy of the text, bytes, and hex dump suggests it is not a simple substitution cipher but something more complex, possibly a block cipher. The 16-byte length hints at symmetric block ciphers. Given the lack of a key, you may reason the key will be somewhat predictable. By using AES decryption in ECB mode with a zero key, the correct solution is revealed.
