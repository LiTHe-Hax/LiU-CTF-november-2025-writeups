In this OSINT challenge the flag is gathered piece by piece across several online platforms linked to Torbjörn. The first part is found in his Hacker News profile description, which hints at sending an email to an address listed on the LiTHe Hax website. The email’s body contains the second part of the flag, and the signature image filename leads to an Instagram account where a hashtag reveals the third part. One unusual hashtag matches post on Twitter (X), where another part of the flag can be found in the banner image. The X bio also mentions Torbjörn’s personal website. The website’s HTML source contains yet another piece hidden in a comment. Finally, the website domain points to a GitHub profile, where the user’s status contains the last segment, completing the full flag when all parts were combined.
The different flag parts are base64 encoded, and has to be transformed: base64_string -> (decode) -> flag_word_position-base64_string -> (ignore flag_word_position) -> base64_string -> (decode) -> word
