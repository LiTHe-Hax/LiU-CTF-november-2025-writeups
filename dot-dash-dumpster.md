1. The Morse audio translates to the string UNKqhzcfgre by decoding using morse code tables.
2. The description contains the phrase "great raccoon emperor caesar". The word caesar suggests a Caesar cipher (shift cipher). A Caesar cipher over the 26-letter English alphabet has only 26 possible shifts, so brute-forcing is trivial.
3. The final decoded plaintext is HAXdumpster. This is due to morse code not being able to transfer { }.
   so it is assumed that the solver understands that the entire flag is HAX{dumpster}.
